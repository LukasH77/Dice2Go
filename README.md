# Dice2Go :game_die:

This is my first 'proper' self-made Android app and it's basically what the name says.
It offers six different types of dice, ranging from a d4 to a d20 - an arbitrary combination of up to six dice can be rolled simultaniously.
The dice themselves I designed using Blender, what you see are basically rendered photos of the individual sides 'rolling'.

I am aware that from an architectual standpoint the codes is by no means perfect, I'm not using ViewModels or anything like that, also there isn't really a documentation or comments.
It's mostly a personal project for fun and learning/experience. From my own testing everything works fine although very old phones may have performance issues with the animation. 

By the time (if ever) anyone reads this the app should be available on the Google Play Store it's currently under review.

Have fun! :grin:
